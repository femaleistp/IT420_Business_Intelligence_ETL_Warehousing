KPIs go at the top because they give the highest-level view of the analysis subject, and they change as the executive makes selections such as different years or if they point to a specific part of the line chart or clustered bar chart. I chose to highlight the top-selling category (sales amount) next to the total sales (all categories) because, to me, it gave a good pair of data at a high-level view to compare. You can see in 2013 the bikes sold $15M while overall sales were $16M, so a huge percentage of the profit came from bikes. The bar chart was huge, so I put it to the right, away from the slicer for year selection, to allow it to expand fully; otherwise, the executive would need to scroll through it to see the smaller categories or subcategories. Normally I’d stack the line chart above the bar chart, but space did not permit that. The annotation could apply to both the line chart and the bar chart to say that bikes consistently dominate sales. The second part is specific to the bar chart, that Mountain Bikes, a subcategory of Bikes, has the largest profit, which is shown specifically in the bar chart and not the line chart, although the line chart does show Bikes well above the rest of the two other categories, Clothing and Accessories. I personally noticed the huge gap in sales between the Bikes and the other two categories in the line chart. Then in the bar chart the three Bike subcategories were way ahead of the rest, but after that, in number four, were Tires and Tubes close to Helmets, both accessories. Then Clothing came in with Jerseys and Shorts, then five Accessories and two Clothing, one accessory and one clothing. It would show that Bikes are the greatest point of sales and the other categories offer little profit to the company.
